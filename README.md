## AutoAd.py
### Warning: This is a selfbot and is against discord's TOS

AutoAd is a tool for auto advertising your services in discord market channels.

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
- Put your token and channel IDs in config.yml
- Put your message in message.txt
  - If you have custom emotes in your message, you have to put them like this: **<:name:ID>**, not **:emoji:**
- Start the bot with `start.bat`

### Troubleshooting
If you have some issues you can enable debug mode in config. It will show every message being sent to find the issue.
If that doesn't work you can start an [issue](https://github.com/XtramCZ/auto-advertise-py/issues).
